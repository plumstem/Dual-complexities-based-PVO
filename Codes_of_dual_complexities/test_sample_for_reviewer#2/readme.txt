**This is a test sample for the suggestion of Reviewer #2.

Files description:

	1. dataset

	    You can add your own test images into this folder, and the program can read the images.
	    Owing to the space constraint, the 1000 randomly selected images from the BOSSbase 1.01 dataset are not given.

	1. PVO

	    This folder contains the source code of the paper: X. Li, J. Li, B. Li, B. Yang, High-fidelity reversible data hiding scheme based on pixel-value-ordering and prediction-error expansion, Signal
	    Process. 93 (1) (2013) 198â€“205.
	    You can construct your own dataset and directly run the "main.m" file.
	    After the execution of program, the results will be wirtten into a ".xlsx" file. 

	2. Dual_complexities_based_PVO

	    This folder contains the source code of the proposed dual-complexities based PVO scheme.
	    You can construct your own dataset and directly run the "main.m" file.
	    After the execution of program, the results will be wirtten into a ".xlsx" file. 

	3. PVO_PSNR_BOSSbase(1000_random_selected_images).xlsx

	    This file contains the PSNR result of the PVO scheme on 1000 randomly selected images from the BOSSbase 1.01 dataset.

	4. dual_complexities_PVO_PSNR_BOSSbase(1000_random_selected_images).xlsx

	    This file contains the PSNR result of the proposed dual-complexities based PVO scheme on 1000 randomly selected images from the BOSSbase 1.01 dataset.
